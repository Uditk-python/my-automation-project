☑️opening a file:
  ✅file_object=open('file_name',"r")
     fole_object.close
  ✅with open("file_name","r")

1)Reading a File :
  ✅read - fileobject.read(n)  where n refers to number to bytes
  ✅readline - fileobject.readline(n)  where n refers to number to bytes
  ✅readlines - fileobject.readlines()  returns all the lines in the file
2)Writing or Appending a File
  ✅write-fileobject.write(content)  where content refers to content to be added in file
  ✅writelines-fileobject.writelie(content)  where content refers to list of lines to be added in file
⛏️main difference between writing and appending is writing will overwrite while append will add in file
